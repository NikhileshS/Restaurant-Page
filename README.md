This project was a BIG step up! I learnt about so many advanced concepts like Webpack &amp; ES6 Modules and applied them in this project!  On the front-end side, this project wasn't much. Part of the reason was because I'm running behind schedule. On the script side, I nailed all the topics I learnt. I used Webpack and ES6 Modules flawlessly.
